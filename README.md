Project Description

Project Overview
This project demonstrates launching a scalable and highly available web application on AWS using best practices for compute scalability, security, and cost optimization.

The architecture uses:

Amazon EC2 for compute resources.

Application Load Balancer (ALB) for traffic routing.

Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for auto-scaling.

Amazon RDS  for relational database management.

CloudWatch & SNS for monitoring and alerting.

IAM for secure role-based access management 



Major Benefits: |
 High Availability: Utilize ALB and ASG to ensure zero |
downtime. |

Scalability: Automatically scale resources based on demand |
to maintain optimal performance. |

 Security: Implement IAM for managing permissions and |
ensuring security. |
